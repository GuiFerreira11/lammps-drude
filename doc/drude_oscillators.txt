Drude oscillators :h3

[Overview:]

This doc page gives detail about how to use the LAMMPS atom style drude
for simulating polarizable atoms using thermalized Drude oscillators.

The atom style drude is set by the "atom_style"_atom_style.html command 
{atom_style drude} in the input file.
This atom style is similar to the atom style {full}. 
The atoms possess a charge, and bonds, angles, dihedrals and impropers 
can be defined.

Polarizable atoms acquire an electric dipole moment under the action of 
an external electric field.
Drude oscillators represent these dipoles by two point charges close to 
each other.
In LAMMPS, each polarizable atom is split into two non-polarizable atoms:
the core and the Drude particle.
The Drude particle can be thought of as the electron cloud around the nucleus.

[Data file:]

Both the core atom and the Drude particle should be present in the 
data file. 
The sum of their masses should be the mass of the initial (unsplit) atom. 
The sum of their charges should be the charge of the initial (unsplit) atom.
A "harmonic bond"_bond_harmonic.html between the core and Drude partners should 
be present as a standard bond in the {Bonds} section of the data file. 
It should have zero equilibrium length and its (half-)stiffness should be related 
to the atom polarizability \(\alpha\) and to the charge of the Drude particle 
\(q\) by
\begin\{equation\} K = \frac 1 2\, \frac \{q^2\} \alpha \end\{equation\}

Ideally, the mass of the Drude particle should be very small, and the
stiffness of the harmonic bond should be very high, so that the Drude particle
remains close ot the core. However, this implies very fast ocillations of the 
Drude particle and requires a very small time step.
A reasonable compromise is about 0.4 g/mol for the Drude particle and about
500 kcal/mol/Ang^2 for the (half-)stiffness.

An additional section called {Drude Types} must be present in the data file.
It should contain one line per atom type formatted as :b
    {atom_type_id drude_type} :pre
where {atom_type_id} is the id of the atom type and {drude_type} is :b
    0 for a non-polarizable atom type (typically hydrogen atoms) :b
    1 for the types of the cores of polarizable atoms :b
    2 for the types of the Drude particles :b
The core-Drude particle pairs are identified by looking up the bonds connecting
any Drude particle (particles whose type has Drude type 2).

[Special screening:]

The core and Drude partners of a pair should not interact together via Coulomb 
interaction.
So the {special_bonds} command should impose a {coul} factor of 0. for 1-2 neighbors,
which is the default.
Furthermore, the list of special neighbors is redefined, so that the Drude particles
are equivalent to their core. Like this, the same factor is applied to both atoms of
the pair.
This may require to increase the memory reserved for storing the list of special neighbors.
This can be done using the {extra} keyword of the {special_bonds} command.

The interaction between dipoles should normally not be reduced by the {coul} factors of
{special_bonds}.
The "pair_style thole"_pair_thole.html can be used for this purpose and for applying
a Thole screening instead.
See the doc of this pair style for more information.

[Thermalization:]

The Drude oscillators can be thermalized at a low temperature, to approximate
a self consistent field.
This can be done with a langevin thermostat using a specific "fix 
langevin_drude"_fix_langevin_drude.html as described in "(Jiang)"_#Jiang
or with a lagrangian method (Nose-Hoover thermostat) using "fix 
drude/transform"_fix_drude_transform.html as described in "(Lamoureux)"_#Lamoureux.
