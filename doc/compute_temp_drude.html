</PRE>
<P><B>Description:</B>
</P>
<P>Define a computation that calculates the temperatures of core-Drude
pairs.  This compute is designed to be used with the thermalized Drude
oscillator model. The Drude oscillators consist of a core particle and
a Drude particle connected by a harmonic bond, and the relative motion
of these Drude oscillators is usually maintained cold by a specific
thermostat that acts on the relative motion of the core-Drude particle
pairs. Therefore, because LAMMPS considers Drude particles as normal
atoms in its default temperature compute, the reduced temperature of
the core-Drude particle pairs is not calculated correctly.
</P>
<P>This compute calculates the temperature of the cores using
center-of-mass velocities of the core-Drude pairs, and the reduced
temperature of the Drude particles using the relative velocities of
the Drude particles with respect to their cores. Non-polarizable atoms
are considered as cores. Their velocities contribute to the temperature
of the cores.

<P><B>Output info:</B>
</P>
<P>This compute calculates a global vector of 6 components which can be
accessed by various <A HREF = "Section_howto.html#howto_15">output commands</A>. The
meaning of the components are
</P>
<OL><LI>temperature of the centers of mass (temperature units) 

<LI>temperature of the dipoles (temperature units) 

<LI>number of degrees of freedom of the centers of mass 

<LI>number of degrees of freedom of the dipoles 

<LI>kinetic energy of the centers of mass (energy units) 

<LI>kinetic energy of the dipoles (energy units) 
</OL>
<P><B>Restrictions:</B>
</P>
<P>The number of degrees of freedom contributing to the temperature is
assumed to be constant for the duration of the run unless the 
<I>fix_modify</I> command sets the option <I>dynamic yes</I>.
