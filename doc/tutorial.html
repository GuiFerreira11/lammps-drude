<H3>Thermalized Drude oscillators in LAMMPS: tutorial 
</H3>
<P>In this tutorial we explain how to use <A HREF = "drude_oscillators.html">Drude oscillators</A> in LAMMPS to simulate polarizable systems.
As an example, we are going to simulate 250 phenol molecules.
</P>
<HR>

<P><B>Preparation of the data file</B>
</P>
<P>The data file is similar to a standard LAMMPS data file for <I>atom_style full</I>, 
except for an additional section <I>Drude Types</I> identifying which types are non-polarizable atoms (0),
core of polarizable atoms (DC: 1) or Drude particles (DP: 2).
The DPs and the <I>harmonic bonds</I> connecting them to their DC should appear in the data file
as normal atoms and bonds.
</P>
<P>You can use the <A HREF = "pol.html">polarizer</A> tool to convert a non-polarizable
data file (here <I>data.102494.lmp</I>) to a polarizable data file (<I>data-p.lmp</I>)
</P>
<PRE>polarizer.py -q -f phenol.dff data.102494.lmp data-p.lmp 
</PRE>
<P>This will automatically insert the new atoms and bonds and the <I>Drude Types</I> section.
The masses and charges of DCs and DPs are computed from <I>phenol.dff</I>, as well as the DC-DP bond constants.
The file <I>phenol.dff</I> contains notably the polarizabilities of the atom types and the mass of the Drude particles, for instance:
</P>
<PRE># units: kJ/mol, A, deg
# kforce is in the form k/2 r_D^2
# type  m_D/u   q_D/e    k_D   alpha/A3  thole
OH      0.4    -1.0    4184.0   0.6213   4
CA      0.4    -1.0    4184.0   1.3226   4
CAI     0.4    -1.0    4184.0   1.3226   4 
</PRE>
<P>The hydrogen atoms are absent from this file, so they will be treated as non-polarizable atoms.
The non-polarizable data file <I>data.102494.lmp</I> has to specify the names of the atom types as comments at the end of lines of the <I>Masses</I> section.
You probably need to edit it to add these names. It should look like
</P>
<PRE>Masses 
</PRE>
<PRE>1 12.011 # CAI
2 12.011 # CA
3 15.999 # OH
4 1.008  # HA
5 1.008  # HO 
</PRE>
<HR>

<P><B>Basic input file</B>
</P>
<P>The polarizer script also outputs a few lines related to the <I>input</I> file. 
We will explain later how to use this output.
In order for LAMMPS to recognize that you are using Drude oscillators, you should use the atom style <I>drude</I>.
</P>
<PRE>atom_style drude 
</PRE>
<P>This atom style is similar to <I>full</I>. You can defined thus atomic charges and molecular bonds, angles, dihedrals...
In addition, LAMMPS will understand the <I>Drude Types</I> section of the new data file.
It will find and store matching DC-DP pairs and will treat DP as equivalent to their DC in the <I>special bonds</I> relations.
It may be necessary to extend the space for storing such special relations.
In this case extra space should be reserved by using the <I>extra</I> keyword of the <I>special_bonds</I> command.
With our phenol, there is 1 more special neighbor for which space is required.
Otherwise LAMMPS crashes and gives the required value.
</P>
<PRE>special_bonds lj/coul 0.0 0.0 0.5 extra 1 
</PRE>
<P>Let us assume we want to run a simple NVT simulation at 300 K.
Note that Drude oscillators need to be thermalized at a low temperature in order to approximate a self-consistent field (SCF), 
so it is not possible to simulate an NVE ensemble with this package.
Since dipoles are approximated by a charged DC-DP pair, the <I>pair_style</I> must include charge interactions, 
for instance <I>lj/cut/coul/long</I> with <I>kspace_style pppm</I>. For example with a cutoff of 10. and a precision 1.e-4:
</P>
<PRE>pair_style lj/cut/coul/long 10.0
kspace_style pppm 1.0e-4 
</PRE>
<P>As compared to the non-polarizable input file, you need to add <I>pair_coeff</I> lines for the DPs. 
Since the DPs have no Lennard-Jones interactions, their <I>epsilon</I> is 0.
So the only <I>pair_coeff</I> line you need to add is
</P>
<PRE>pair_coeff * 6* 0.0 0.0 # All-DPs 
</PRE>
<P>Now for the thermalization, the simplest choice is to use the <A HREF = "fix_langevin_drude.html">fix langevin/drude</A>.
</P>
<PRE>fix LANG all langevin/drude 300. 100. 12435 1. 20. 13977 
</PRE>
<P>This applies a Langevin thermostat at temperature 300. to the centers of mass of the DC-DP pairs, 
with relaxation time 100. and with random seed 12345.
This applies also a Langevin thermostat at temperature 1. to the relative motion of the DPs around their DCs, 
with relaxation time 20. and random seed 13977. 
Only the DCs and non-polarizable atoms need to be in the fix group. 
LAMMPS will thermostate the DPs together with their DC.
For this, ghost atoms need to know their velocities. Thus you need to add the following command:
</P>
<PRE>comm_modify vel yes 
</PRE>
<P>If you want to avoid that the center of mass of the whole system drifts due to the random forces of the Langevin thermostat on DCs, 
you can add the <I>zero yes</I> option at the end of the fix line.
If you want to use the fix <I>shake</I> to constrain the C-H bonds, you should add it after the fix <I>langevin/drude</I> for more accuracy.
Since the fix <I>langevin/drude</I> does not time-integrate (just forces modifications, no position/velocity updates), 
the <I>nve</I> fix should be used in conjunction.
</P>
<PRE>fix NVE all nve 
</PRE>
<P>Finally, do not forget to update the atom type elements if you use them in a <I>dump_modify ... element ...</I> command,
by adding the element type of the DPs. Here for instance
</P>
<PRE>dump DUMP all custom 10 dump.lammpstrj id mol type element x y z ix iy iz
dump_modify DUMP element C C O H H D D D 
</PRE>
<P>The input file should now be ready for use!
</P>
<P>You will notice that the global temperature <I>thermo_temp</I> computed by LAMMPS is not 300. K as wanted.
This is because LAMMPS treats DPs as standard atoms in his default compute.
If you want to output the temperatures of the DC-DP pair centers of mass and of the DPs relative to their DCs, you should
use <I>thermo_style custom</I> with respectively <I>f_LANG[1]</I> and <I>f_LANG[2]</I>. These should be close to 300. and 1. on average.
</P>
<PRE>thermo_style custom step temp f_LANG[1] f_LANG[2] 
</PRE>
<HR>

<P><B>Thole screening</B>
</P>
<P>Standard dipole-dipole interactions are not stable in general.
If the atomic polarizability is too high for instance, a DP can escape from its DC and be captured by another DC, 
which makes the force and energy diverge and the simulation crash.
Often, special bond relations prevent bonded neighbors to see the charge of each other's DP, 
so that the problem does not always appear.
It is possible to use screened dipole dipole interactions by using the <A HREF = "pair_thole.html"><I>pair_style thole</I></A>.
This is a correction to the coulomb pair_styles which stabilizes the interactions between those charges which represent dipoles.
It is to be used as <I>hybrid/overlay</I> with any standard <I>coul</I> pair style.
In our example, we would use
</P>
<PRE>pair_style hybrid/overlay lj/cut/coul/long 10.0 thole 2.6 10.0 
</PRE>
<P>This tells LAMMPS that we are using two pair_style. 
The first one is as above (<I>lj/cut/coul/long 10.0</I>).
The second one is a <I>thole</I> pair_style with screening factor 2.6 and cutoff 10.0.
</P>
<P>Since <I>hybrid/overlay</I> does not support mixing rules, the interaction coefficients of all the pairs 
of atom types with i < j should be explicitly defined.
The output of the <I>polarizer</I> script can be used to complete the <I>pair_coeff</I> section of the input file.
In our example, this will look like
</P>
<PRE>pair_coeff    1    1 lj/cut/coul/long    0.0700   3.550

</PRE>
<P>For the <I>thole</I> pair style the coefficients are 
</P>
<OL><LI>the atom polarizability in cubic length unit
<LI>the screening factor of the Thole function (optional, default defined by the pair_style command)
<LI>the cutoff (optional, default defined by the pair_style command) 
</OL>
<P>The special neighbors have charge-charge and charge-dipole interactions screened by the <I>coul</I> factors 
of the <I>special_bonds</I> command (0., 0., and 0.5 in the example above).
Without using the pair_style <I>thole</I>, dipole-dipole interactions are screened by the same factor.
By using the pair_style <I>thole</I>, dipole-dipole interactions are screened by Thole's function, whatever
their special relationship (except inside the DC-DP pair of course). 
Consider for example 1-2 neighbors: using the pair_style <I>thole</I>, their dipoles will see each other (despite the <I>coul</I> factor being 0)
and the interactions between these dipoles will be stabilized by Thole's function.

<P><B>Thermostats and barostats</B>
</P>
<P>Using a Nose-Hoover barostat with the <I>langevin/drude</I> thermostat is straightforward using fix <I>nph</I> instead of <I>nve</I>.
For example:
</P>
<PRE>fix NPH all nph iso 1. 1. 500. 
</PRE>
<P>It is also possible to use a Nose-Hoover instead of Langevin thermostat.
This requires to use the fixes <A HREF = "drude_transform.html"><I>drude/transform</I></A> just before and after the time intergation fixes.
The fixes <I>drude/transform/direct</I> converts the atomic mass, position, velocities and forces into a reduced 
representation, where the DCs transform into the centers of mass of the DC-DP pairs and the DPs transform into their relative
position with respect to their DC. The fix <I>drude/transform/inverse</I> does the same backwards.
For a NVT simulation, with the DCs and atoms at 300 K and the DPs at 1 K relative to their DC one would use
</P>
<PRE>fix DIRECT all drude/transform/direct
fix NVT1 ATOMS nvt temp 300. 300. 100.
fix NVT2 DRUDES nvt temp 1. 1. 20.
fix INVERSE all drude/transform/inverse 
</PRE>
<P>For our phenol example, the groups would be defined as
</P>
<PRE>group ATOMS  type 1 2 3 4 5 # DCs and non-polarizable atoms
group CORES  type 1 2 3     # DCs
group DRUDES type 6 7 8     # DPs 
</PRE>
<P>Note that with the fixes <I>drude/transform</I>, it is not required to specify <I>comm_modify vel yes</I> because the fixes to it anyway
(several times and for the forces also).
To avoid the flying ice cube artifact, where the atoms progressively freeze and the center of mass of the whole system drifts faster and faster, 
the fix <I>momentum</I> can be used. For instance:
</P>
<PRE>fix MOMENTUM all momentum 100 linear 1 1 1 
</PRE>
<P>It is a bit more tricky to run a NPT simulation with Nose-Hoover barostat and thermostat.
First, the volume should be integrated only once. So the fix for DCs and atoms should be <I>npt</I>
while the fix for DPs should be <I>nvt</I> (or vice versa).
Second, the fix <I>npt</I> computes a global pressure and thus a global temperature whatever the fix group.
We do want the pressure to correspond to the whole system, but we want the temperature to correspond to the fix group only.
We must then use the <I>fix_modify</I> command for this.
In the end, the block of instructions for thermostating and barostating will look like
</P>
<PRE>compute TATOMS ATOMS temp
fix DIRECT all drude/transform/direct
fix NPT ATOMS npt temp 300. 300. 100. iso 1. 1. 500.
fix_modify NPT temp TATOMS press thermo_press
fix NVT DRUDES nvt temp 1. 1. 20.
fix INVERSE all drude/transform/inverse 
</PRE>
<HR>

<P><B>Rigid bodies</B>
</P>
<P>You may want to simulate phenol as a rigid body (but polarizable).
Another common use case is the water model called SWM4-NDP, which is a kind of polarizable TIP4P.
In this case, the rigid bodies and the DPs should be integrated separately, even with the Langevin thermostat.
Let us review the different thermostats and ensemble combinations.
