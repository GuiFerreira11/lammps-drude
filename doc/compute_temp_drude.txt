compute temp/drude command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID temp/drude :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "compute"_compute.html command
temp/drude = style name of this compute command
                        
[Examples:]

compute TDRUDE all temp/drude :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that calculates the temperature based on the
center-of-mass velocities of pairs of Drude cores and Drude particles,
bonded by springs.  This compute is designed to be used with the
thermalized Drude oscillator model.

Specifically, this compute enables calculation of the temperature of
the Drude particles in relative coordinates with respect to their
cores.

[Output info:]


[Restrictions:]

The number of core-Drude pairs contributing to the temperature is
assumed to be constant for the duration of the run.

[Related commands:]


[Default:] none
