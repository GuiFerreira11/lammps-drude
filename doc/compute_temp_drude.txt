compute temp/drude command :h3

[Syntax:]

compute ID group-ID temp/drude :pre

ID, group-ID are documented in "compute"_compute.html command
temp/drude = style name of this compute command
                        
[Examples:]

compute TDRUDE all temp/drude :pre

[Description:]

Define a computation that calculates the temperatures of core-Drude
pairs.  This compute is designed to be used with the thermalized Drude
oscillator model. The Drude oscillators consist of a core particle and
a Drude particle connected by a harmonic bond, and the relative motion
of these Drude oscillators is usually maintained cold by a specific
thermostat that acts on the relative motion of the core-Drude particle
pairs. Therefore, because LAMMPS considers Drude particles as normal
atoms in its default tmeperature compute, the reduced temperature of
the core-Drude particle pairs is not calculated correctly.

This compute calculates the temperature of the cores using
center-of-mass velocities of the core-Drude pairs, and the reduced
temperature of the Drude particles using the relative velocities of
the Drude particles with respect to their cores.


[Output info:]

This compute calculates a global vector of 6 components which can be
accessed by various "output commands"_Section_howto.html#howto_15. The
meaning of the components are

temperature of the centers of mass (temperature units) :olb,l
temperature of the dipoles (temperature units) :l
number of degrees of freedom of the centers of mass :l
number of degrees of freedom of the dipoles :l
kinetic energy of the centers of mass (energy units) :l
kinetic energy of the dipoles (energy units) :l,ole


[Restrictions:]

The number of core-Drude pairs contributing to the temperature is
assumed to be constant for the duration of the run.
